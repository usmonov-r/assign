Step 1

Linux was originally developed as a free operating system for personal computers
 based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more computer
 hardware platforms than any other operating system.
Because of the dominance of
 Android on smartphones, Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose
 operating systems.
Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such
 as mainframe computers and virtually all fastest supercomputers, but is used on only
 around 2.3% of desktop computers when not including Chrome OS, which has about
 5% of the overall and nearly 20% of the sub-$300 notebook sales.

Linux also runs on embedded systems, which are devices whose operating system is
 typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system.
